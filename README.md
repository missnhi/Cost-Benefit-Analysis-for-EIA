# Cost-Benefit-Analysis-for-EIA
### I. Comparative Analysis and Trend Prediction

#### **Comparative Analysis (from year 2019-2023)**

I choose the various hardware and software based on personal research and some of the numbers for those hardware and software are hypothetical. The ultimate goal is to conduct cost-benefit analyses for various hardware and software acquisitions. This will be used to support data-driven decisions for procurement and disposal.

The software that i choose to analyze are Microsoft Dynamics and DXC Enterprise Asset Management . As EIA grow and expand, it's important for them to invest in a reliable and scalable enterprise resourse planning (ERP) system. Dynamics 365 Business Central is a popular choice for growing businesses due to its flexibility, functionality, and ease of use. However, one of the biggest questions businesses have is how much does it cost to implement Dynamics 365 and DXC Enterprise Asser Management?

##### Here is the cost breakdown that I made in Excel.

The reasons for the prices different is that: 
- DXC Enterprise Asset Management (DXC EAM) is used for EAM processes, including large-scale asset management, maintenance planning and work order management. This software has advanced features that include an entire lifecycle for physical assets (utilities, transportation, etc) that add to the complexity. 
- Microsoft Dynamics is used for core finance and operations capabilities, including finance, human resources, procurement and inventory workloads. These activities are less specialized compared to DXC, thus, they costs significantly less than DXC.

#### **Benefits of these software:** 
    -    Saving time in operations by increase accuracy, reduced delays, lower maintainance costs. 
    -    Increase revenue by raising passenger satisfaction. 
    -    Automating the asset management and maintenance processes, to capture a large percentage of EIA assets. 
    -    Reduce numerous spreadsheets and the difficulty of extracting information from the system. 


### II. Total Intangible Asset Analysis from annual reports (2019-2023)
Finally, I collected real data from four annual reports of Edmonton International Airport from 2019 to 2024 on the cost of purchased computer software and software licenses within their finite useful lives. This aims to see the realistic money that was put into computer software. 
Here is a chart that show the change in intangible asset over the year from pre-COVID to today

Below is the data of intangible assets that I collected from the annual reports for reference:

1.  **Computer Software**
    -   **Cost**: There has been a major decrease in the cost of computer software from 2019 ($12,558,000) to 2020 ($12,813,000) to 2021 ($10,389,000), followed by a larger decrease in 2022 ($9,262,000) and then a slight increase in 2023 ($9,818,000).
    -   **Accumulated Amortization**: The accumulated amortization has been increasing, which represent the constant depreciation of software assets yearly.
    -   **Net Book Value**: The net book value of computer software has decreased consistently from 2019 ($4,333,000) to 2023 ($575,000), which also represent a reduction in the remaining value of these assets.
2.  **Software Under Development**

    -   **Cost**: The cost of software under development fluctuates throughout the years because of COVID-19. There was a significant investments in 2023 ($2,372,000) compared to earlier years. This is applausible as EIA is getting back to the business prior-Covid. 
    -   **Net Book Value**: The net book value has increased substantially in 2023 ($2,372,000) from 2022 ($748,000) and 2021 ($27,000), indicating increased development activities as there's little activities during covid year (2020-2022).
3.  **Total Intangible Assets**

    -   **Cost**: There has been an overall decrease in the cost of total intangible assets from 2019 ($13,164,000) to 2022 ($10,010,000), with an increase in 2023 ($12,190,000).
    -   **Accumulated Amortization**: The accumulated amortization consistently increased, aligning with the depreciation of computer software over the year.
    -   **Net Book Value**: The net book value decreased from 2019 ($4,404,000) to 2022 ($2,045,000) but saw an increase in 2023 ($2,947,000), this could be explained by the rise in software under development.

### Trend Prediction for 2024

Given the trends from 2019 to 2023, here is my predictions for 2024:

1.  **Investment in New Software**

    -   After a reduction in investments during the COVID-19 years (2019-2022), there is an uptick in investing in software under development. This trend will likly continue as the airport recovers and expands its technology.
2.  **Continued Amortization**

    -   Accumulated amortization for computer software will increase as current assets depreciate yearly.
3.  **Net Book Value (NBV)** 

    -   The NBV of computer software seems to decrease more as older software assets became fully amortized.
    -   TheNBV of software under development might increase as new projects start and existing projects are completed.
4.  **Overall Intangible Assets**

    -   The total cost of intangible assets may continue to rise, as the airport put more money in new investments in software development.
    -   The net book value may remain the same or increase slightly if new software development outpaces the amortization of older software.

### Summary

The financial data from 2019 to 2023 indicates a strategic shift towards investing in new software development, especially post-COVID-19. While existing software assets are amortized and their value decreases, new development projects are likely to drive the net book value of intangible assets up in 2024. This suggests a focus on modernization and expansion of the airport's technological infrastructure so that it can return to the pre-covid level in 2019.
