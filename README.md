### Comparative Analysis and Trend Prediction

#### **Comparative Analysis (from year 2019-2023)**

1.  **Computer Software**

    -   **Cost**: There has been a noticeable decrease in the cost of computer software from 2019 ($12,813,000) to 2021 ($10,389,000), followed by a further decrease in 2022 ($9,262,000) and a slight increase in 2023 ($9,818,000).
    -   **Accumulated Amortization**: The accumulated amortization has generally increased each year, reflecting ongoing depreciation of software assets.
    -   **Net Book Value**: The net book value of computer software has decreased consistently from 2019 ($4,333,000) to 2023 ($575,000), indicating a reduction in the remaining value of these assets.
2.  **Software Under Development**

    -   **Cost**: The cost of software under development saw fluctuations, with significant investments in 2023 ($2,372,000) compared to earlier years.
    -   **Net Book Value**: The net book value has increased substantially in 2023 ($2,372,000) from 2022 ($748,000) and 2021 ($27,000), indicating increased development activities.
3.  **Total Intangible Assets**

    -   **Cost**: There has been an overall decrease in the cost of total intangible assets from 2019 ($13,164,000) to 2022 ($10,010,000), with an increase in 2023 ($12,190,000).
    -   **Accumulated Amortization**: The accumulated amortization consistently increased, aligning with the depreciation of computer software.
    -   **Net Book Value**: The net book value decreased from 2019 ($4,404,000) to 2022 ($2,045,000) but saw an increase in 2023 ($2,947,000), driven by the rise in software under development.

### Trend Prediction (2019-2024)

Given the trends from 2019 to 2023, we can make some predictions for 2024:

1.  **Investment in New Software**

    -   After a reduction in investments during the COVID-19 years (2019-2021), there is an upward trend in investing in software under development. This trend is likely to continue as the airport recovers and expands its technological capabilities.
2.  **Continued Amortization**

    -   Accumulated amortization for computer software will likely increase as existing assets continue to depreciate.
3.  **Net Book Value**

    -   The net book value of computer software is expected to decrease further as older software assets are fully amortized.
    -   The net book value of software under development is likely to increase as new projects are initiated and existing projects are completed.
4.  **Overall Intangible Assets**

    -   The total cost of intangible assets may continue to rise, reflecting new investments in software development.
    -   The net book value may stabilize or increase slightly if the pace of new software development continues to outpace the amortization of existing software.

### Summary

The financial data from 2019 to 2023 indicates a strategic shift towards investing in new software development, especially post-COVID-19. While existing software assets are being amortized and their value decreases, new development projects are likely to drive the net book value of intangible assets up in 2024. This suggests a focus on modernization and expansion of the airport's technological infrastructure.
